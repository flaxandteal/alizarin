title: Background
description: Motivation for Alizarin
---

Alizarin began as a need for a static site for [Arches](https://archesproject.org),
for Northern Ireland's Historic Environment Division of the [Department for Communities](https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/).
Arches itself is a complex system, whose strengths are based on its ability
to handle large amounts of detailed records, flexibility and in a highly-structured way.
However, much of this functionality is unnecessary for the majority of public visitors
and can lead to inefficiency in scaling.

This project is based on the insight that much of the public-facing functionality of Arches
that is relevant to rapid-search can be derived easily from its native data structures.
Moreover, those data structures can be read and written efficiently, and are relatively efficient for
communicating data. In Arches itself, much of the work is done on the back-end, for a range
of reasons - in particular, providing a degree of flexibility and integration with individual user roles,
etc. Alizarin makes the trade-off that, beyond filtering of data for permissions, most rendering can be done
efficiently client-side, using lazy-loading and lazy-hydration using Arches native data transfer format.

The principal use-case of this was to support a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site for public data access
that was cheaply scalable, database-less and static. Data can be exported nightly, and the static site
rebuilt using Alizarin directly from standard Arches export dumps.

## Goals

Alizarin aims to:

1. **Simplify Arches Development**: Provide an intuitive, developer-friendly interface to Arches' complex data models
2. **Enable Modern Web Applications**: Support building reactive, performant front-end applications with Arches data
3. **Maintain Flexibility**: Work with any Arches instance without requiring server-side modifications
4. **Ensure Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript to catch errors early and improve developer experience
5. **Optimize Performance**: Minimize network requests and memory usage through intelligent caching and lazy loading
6. **Allow a Range of Clients**: Make writing Arches clients within third-party stacks simple, consistent and efficient

## Non-Goals

Alizarin does **not** aim to:

1. **Replace Arches**: Arches necessarily implements a range of complex logic that is necessary for safely designing and managing semantic graphs. To rebuild this would lose the benefits of Alizarin.
2. **Support All Arches APIs**: Alizarin should only use the most basic read and write APIs, expecting minimal manipulation.
3. **Run on Back-end Servers**: Alizarin should be useful for Node applications manipulating data, but Arches-like servers are not a goal. Bugs in doing so are likely to be valid Alizarin bugs, but missing features specific to this purpose are unlikely to be prioritized.
4. **Always be JS**: Alizarin is a clean reimplementation of [AORM](https://github.com/flaxandteal/arches-orm/) and the architecture is more important than the code. Parts may be rewritten into Rust/WASM for speed.
5. **Be Hand-Crafted Only**: The first version of Alizarin was written entirely by hand, but future versions will be co-authored with AI tools.
6. **Be Read-Only**: Writing via architecturally clean APIs is a goal, secondary to read behaviour, but this requires future development and evolution of Arches APIs
